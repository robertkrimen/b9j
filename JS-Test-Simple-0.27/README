This is the README file for Test.Simple, basic utilities for writing tests, by
Michael G Schwern <schwern@pobox.com> as ported to JavaScript by David Wheeler
<david@kineticode.com>.

This package also contains Test.Harness and Test.Harness.Browser. You can use
the latter module to run all of your Test.Simple and Test.More tests in a
single browser window, similar to how Perl's Test::Harness allows all tests in
a package to be run with a single shell command.

Please consult the documentation for how to start writing tests for your
JavaScript code.
